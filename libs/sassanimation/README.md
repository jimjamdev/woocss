sassanimation
======

A custom sass animation library based on http://mikefowler.me/companimation/.

This version will include the ability to run without compass so there's no conflict with the latest alpha versions, and the ability to be used through an non-ruby sass compiler such as those available through grunt.

Clean-up of original animation code, and hundreds of animations will be available to use with a simple syntax.

The library will be included by default in the upcoming woocss.com framework.
